# S4_Final_Sprint_Project_2

This project is a reimplementation of a previous project. The previous was written in javascript and this one in Java.

The project includes a Binary Search Tree class and an AVL tree class.
A CLI was developed to allow each tree to be created and saved to a json file. (JSON Simple)

Note: When writing to file right click on file and select reformat code to achieve traditional JSON format.
